# Dragon Curve

## Introduction

Dragon Curve is a member of fractal curves. This fractal curve is iterative, which can be approximed with recursion. This makes Dragon Curve interesting mathematical and computer science problem.

It consists of self-similar axioms forming into unfolded fractal reminding a figure of the dragon, therefore the name "Dragon Curve". It can be seen in the real world, with recursively folding a paper ribbon. Altough, the shape of the dragon is not clearly visible as it is possible with the computer graphics.

It was first discovered by NASA physist John Heighway. So orginally it Dragon Curve is called Harter–Heighway dragon or even Jurassic Park dragon, because it was introduced in the book visualization by Michael Crichton in his famous novel. Heighway's work has been published in Scientific American, Mathematical Games in 1967 based on papers by Chandler Davis and Donald Knuth.

Each iteration is more complex that the previous one. Dragon Curve start as a line segment, which is always duplicated and rotated by 45 degrees to the right or left. Because of its it is ideal proglem for having some fun with recursions instead of Fibonacci numbers that is notorously explained everywhere. Very nice bonus is, that as it is fractal, it has its own visualy appealing representation.

There are many other variants of the Dragon Curve such as Lévy Dragon, Terdragon or Twindragon. Unfortunally, it goes beoynd the scope of this repository.

Purpose of this code is to present an alternative of recursive tasks compared to commonly used example in computer science. It is written in object-oriented paradigm of C++ programming language and `SFML` OpenGL library for drawing objects on the screen.
